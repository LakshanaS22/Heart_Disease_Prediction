# Heart_Disease_Prediction
INTRODUCTION
***Heart disease is the leading cause of death among all other disease, even cancers. Due to lack of resources in the medical field, the prediction of heart disease occasionally may be a problem. Utilisation of suitable technology support in this regard can prove to be highly beneficial to the medical fraternity and patients. The machine learning techniques can be very well adapted to do the prediction of heart disease. The Machine Learning model utilizes the data such as blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and then tries to predict the possible heart disease in patients. This may help in taking preventive measures and hence can try to avoid the possibility of heart disease in patient. So, when a patient is predicted as positive for heart disease, then the medical data for the patient can be closely analysed by the doctors. Some Advantages of the Machine Learning model for Heart Disease are 1.Early prediction of heart disease can be done, 2.The cost of medication will be minimised, 3.Accuracy rate will be high and 4. will have High Performance.

ABOUT THE DATASET
Age: age of the patient [years]
Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
Description: This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer-valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Objective: Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). Build classification models to predict whether or not the patients have Heart Disease. Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
